// I'm going to do some loop work / practice


// for loop(when I do a for loop) I do a for loop when I know the many the times I'm going to do a function. 
// while (when I do a for loop) I do a while loop when I don't know how many times I'm illustrating a function
// do while(it will always go tho the loop at once) Just keep doing it until I'm done.
